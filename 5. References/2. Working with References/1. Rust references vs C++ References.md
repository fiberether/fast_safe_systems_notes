```c++
int x = 32;
int &b = x; // implicit reference

b = 20; // implicit dereferencing
```

Rust is different in this case 

Dot (`.`) or a member accesss operator does implicit dereferences or implicitly borrows if. needed 
```rust
struct Anime { name: &'static str };
let aria = Anime { name: "Aria: The Animation" };
let anime_ref = &aria;

assert_eq!(aria_ref.name, "Aria: The Animation");


let mut v = vec![300, 400];
v.sort();
(&mut v).sort();

```


C++ implicitly converts between references and `lvalue`s (expressions referring to locations in memory)

Once C++ reference is initialized there is no return or way to change
