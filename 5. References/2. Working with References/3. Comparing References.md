`==` (equals) operator follows as many references as needed

```rust
let a = 10;
let b = 10;

let rx = &a;
let ry = &b;

let rrx = &rx;
let rry = &ry;


assert!(rrx == rry)`
```

To work with references itself use `std::ptr::eq`

```rust
assert!(!std::ptr::eq(rx, rry);

assert!(rx == rry); // ERROR , operands must have same type : &i32 == &&i32
```
