> Any built-in number can be casted into any other built-in number


- casting integer to another integer is well-defined
- converting to a **narrower** type = **truncation**
- signed to a wider number = sign extention (increasing number of bits along with the sign preserved)
- unsigned = zero-extended (filled with 0s)


- float to int = truncation/rounding towards 0 ( `-1.99 as i32` = -1)
- if value is too larg, the MAX/MIN is produced (`1e6 as u8` = 255)


# compound types

- `bool`, `char`, `c-like enum`  can be casted into any integer
- casting vice-versa is NOT ALLOWED
- `std::char::from_u32 -> Option<char>`
- `u8 as char` is a valid at any point, since any of 0-255 range can be safely cast into `char` (ASCII)



# reference auto-casts (DEREF COERCIONS)

THESE are called **Deref-coercions**
since all these types implement the `Deref` or `DerefMut` traits

> The purpose of `Deref` is to create **SMART-POINTERS** behave as much close to the underlying type as possible


Some reference cases can be cast automatically by Rust

`&String` -> `&str`
`&Vec<i32>` -> `&[i32]`
`&Box<T>` -> `&T`
