A **block** may contain `ITEM DECLARATION`s 
An item is simply any declaration that can appear globally in program or module (fn, struct, use)


Function iitem IS NOT a closure, so it cannot use stuff from its scope:

```rust
fn show_files(){
	let v = [3; 30];
	fn cmp_by(){
		// cannot use v here
	}
}```
