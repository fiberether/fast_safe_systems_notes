> RUST DOES NOT HAVE UNARY `+`

```rust
println!("{}", +100); // error: expected expression, found `+`
```


```rust
a % b // Has a the same sign as the LEFT-OPERAND


// Can be used on floating-point
1234.567 % 10.0 // approx: 4.567

```


> Rust uses `!` instead of `~` for bitwise-negation (NOT)


> RUST DOES NOT NEED **unsigned-shift** (>>>) operator, since it has UNSIGNED INT


In Rust: **bitwise operators** have higher precedance than **comparsions**

```rust
x & BIT != 0 // (x & BIT) != 0

// UNLIKE IN C:
// x & (BIT != 0)
```
