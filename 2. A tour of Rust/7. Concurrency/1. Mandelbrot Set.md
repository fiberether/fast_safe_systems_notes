### Buttrefly Effect
---
I 1970 **Edward Lorenz** - meteorologist and mathematician has been making attempts to model weather patterns using computers
and discovered that even a little tiny change in initial conditions the model produces vastly different results

this is widely known as **Butterfly Effect** when something very tiny and weak can produce an incredible impact on something big.

In other words a phenomenon of **deterministic chaos**

The formula is next, which is also the same formula for a **Julia Sets**

> `z = z^2 + c`


---



# Mandelbrot Set

Is calculated as 
> z = (     (    **(...)^2 + c)^2**     +    c)^2     +    c


Another example of iterations (**recurrent quadratic equation**)
>$z_1 = z_1$
>$z_2 = z_1^2 + c$
>$z_3 = z_2^2 + c$
> $z_4 = z_3^2 + c$
> $z_5 = z_4^2 + c = z_1$



Often called 
> Embarrassingly parallel algorithm

> The Madenbrod set isdefined as the set of complex *numbers* `c` for which  
> `z` does not fly out to infinity

Squaring `<1` makes it smaller
Squaring `>1` makes it bigger

* if `c`  *< 0.25*  or `c` is *< -2*  , the x eventually becomes *infinitely* large 
* otherwise it is in neighbourhood of zero
```rust
fn mald(c: f64) {
	let mut x = 0;
	loop {
		x = x * x + c;
	}
}
```



For          $z_n = z_n-1^2 + c$       everything within   $-2 <= c <= 0.25$ is a Mandelbrot Set


# same with complex numbers

* *num* crate 

```rust
use num::Complex;

fn withcomplex(c: Complex<f64>) {
	let z = Complex { im: 0.0, re: 0.0 };
	loop {
		z = z * z + c;
	}
}
```




# Using Mandelbrot set to paint points

`c.re` and `c.im` will be used as coordinates on the **Cartesian** plane

**Cartesian coordinate system** -
	system that specifies each point uniquely **by a pair of real numbers** -  _coordinates_
	the origin is (0, 0)



# C value boundaries for z not to jump up to infinity 


APPROXIMATED MALDENBROD SET


* `z.norm_sqr()` - returns the square of `z`'s distance from a circle center if it has left circle of rad 2

```rust
fn mbset(c: Complex<f64>, limit: usize) -> Option<usize> {
	let mut z = Complex { im: 0.0, re: 0.0 };
	for i in 0..limit {
		if z.norm_sqr() > 4.0 {
			return i;
		}
		z = z * z + c;
	}
	None
}
```

* Mandelbrot set
* Cartesian plane
* you can omit digit after dot:
	`let k = 0.;`
